    <h1>Average Daily Cycle of Body Temperature and Activity</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 900px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
      Estrus is a period of heightened sexual receptivity and fertility in female mammals, induced by reproductive hormones. In mice, this period lasts for one day, and recurs every 4 days.
      <br></br>
      On this page, we can observe the average daily activity level and core body temperature cycles of three groups of mouse data: males, females in estrus, and females not in estrus. The data has been smoothed over 30‐minute intervals and aggregated over 14 days to highlight trends.
      <br></br>

      We can see that on average, the female mice have higher temperatures than male mice, but this difference is especially significant during estrus! Estrus started on day 2 and repeated every 4 days<br>
      Temperatures were higher during the light on period than with the light off, reflecting the impact of circadian rhythm on temperature.
      <br></br>
      We can also see that male mice and female mice during estrus had similar activity metrics during the light on period. This shifts when the light is off, with male mice being slightly more active than both female groups. Overall, these differences could be indicative of mating behaviors!
