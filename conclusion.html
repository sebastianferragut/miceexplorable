  <h2>The Impact of Biological Sex on Body Temperature and Activity</h2>


  <p style="max-width: 700px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
    Through this study, we saw that biological sex significantly impacts various health measurements, and that data from different subjects can be highly variable. One key factor in these differences for mice is the estrus cycle, which introduces hormonal fluctuations that can affect physiology and behavior in females.
  <br></br>
  Historically, many biological studies have focused primarily on male subjects to avoid this variability; this rationale leads to gaps in our understanding of female biology and how different drugs, diseases, and disorders present in females.
  <br></br>
  We have found that the impact of estrus on temperature and activity resembles an anticipatable cycle as opposed to random variation in the data. These natural trends we see are crucial to study, and the regularity of these cycles allows for easy and accurate modeling. Including data from a variety of sources, including across sexes, is vitally important in health studies. Mice are common model organisms for biological research, and these experiments are often used as precursors to human health studies, so diversity in this aspect is important for understanding everyone's biology, not just a subset of the population.
  <br></br>
  In conclusion, including female subjects in research is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of biology and effective medical treatments. Additionally, it allows for a more accurate representation of biological diversity, ensuring that health information and intervention are equitable across sexes.
