  <h1>Of Mice and Medicine: The Impact of Biological Sex on Body Temperature and Activity</h1>
  
  <p>
    This study conducted research on both female and male mice observing their body temperature and activity levels. The data was collected over a period of 14 days with data down to the minute. Using lights they were able to control the daily cycles of the mice, allowing us to observe the impact of biological differences between the animals. Below are general visualizations to explore the data. Click on one of them to learn more about the subject.
