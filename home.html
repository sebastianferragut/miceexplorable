  <h2>The Impact of Biological Sex on Body Temperature and Activity</h2>


  <p>
    This study conducted research on both female and male mice observing their body temperature and activity levels. The
    data was collected over a period of 14 days with data down to the minute. Using lights they were able to control the
    daily cycles of the mice, allowing us to observe the impact of biological differences between the animals. Below are
    general visualizations to explore the data. Click on one of them to learn more about the subject.

      The pie charts above show the distribution of temperature and activity across male and female mice.
      We can see that overall, female mice are clustered around higher temperatures in comparison to male mice.
      This reveals insights about gender differences in mice: female mice undergo estrus, the reproductive cycle for
      mice.
      This cycle can cause a rise in body temperature. Curiously, we see a slight drop in activity overall for female
      mice
      in comparison to male mice at the higher ranges. This could be due to the estrus cycle, which may cause a decrease
      in activity. Explore the advanced chart to gain more insights with time-specific visualizations for all mice, as
      well
      as specific mice tracked through the study.
